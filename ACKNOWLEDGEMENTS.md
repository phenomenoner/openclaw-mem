# Acknowledgements

openclaw-mem is heavily inspired by the architecture ideas in:

- https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem

We did **not** copy code from `claude-mem`, but their write-up and design helped validate the value of a practical *memory-layer* for agents:

- capture useful interaction artifacts
- store them locally with clear boundaries
- provide fast, progressive recall back into the agent

Thank you for sharing the architecture publicly.
